We often get so absorbed in work or even in browsing the internet that we forget about the little things like breathing deeply, stretching the body or drinking water to start with.

**Tiny Break** uses those short moments when you open a new tab in the browser to remind you to take care of your mind, body and spirit. It remembers all those small activities which are good for you and it tells you nice things :)

It's quiet, non-invasive and always polite, a good work buddy.

Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
